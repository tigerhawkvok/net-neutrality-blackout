Blackout for Net Neutrality
===========================

This script is meant to black out your page on May 15, 2014 from midnight to midnight local time.

## Instructions

Just download the two files in [`src`](src/) and upload them to your webserver in the same directory. Then insert the following line anywhere in your document:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="PATH_TO_FILE/loadNetNeutralityBlackout.js"></script>
```

And on May 15, your site will be blacked out with social links and links [to email Tom Wheeler](https://www.fcc.gov/leadership/tom-wheeler-mail) and their representatives.
