Blackout for Net Neutrality
===========================

# Want to help out this script?

Fork it and send me pull requests!

I'm hoping to see:

- A public-friendly landing page for me to push to a gh-pages branch
- Make sure this is mobile friendly
- Make it as easy as possible for the viewer to reach THEIR representative and senators
- Social links
- If it doesn't impact load times too much, let's get this looking consistent across all sites. Right now it just throws "duh" overrides on.

# Real Readme

This script is meant to black out your page on May 15, 2014 from midnight to midnight local time.

## Instructions

Just download the two files in [`src`](src/) and upload them to your webserver in the same directory. Then insert the following line anywhere in your document:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="PATH_TO_FILE/loadNetNeutralityBlackout.js"></script>
```

And on May 15, your site will be blacked out with social links and links [to email Tom Wheeler](https://www.fcc.gov/leadership/tom-wheeler-mail) and their representatives.
